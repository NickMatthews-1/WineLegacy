# Wine Legacy Scripts
These are my install scripts for the Legacy version of Wine 

To make the file executable do the following. 
> chmod +x ./W7U20-Stable.sh and to run 

Then
> ./W7U20-Stable.sh

From there Wine will install without any issues.

### Naming Convention

All files beginning with ```W7``` are to be considered Wine 7.0 or in the 7.0 family.
Any file that has a letter as the third character denotes the operating system EG ```W7U``` stands for Wine 7 Ubuntu.
Any file with a numbering after the 2nd letter means the operating system version. EG ```W7U18``` Means, Wine 7 for Ubuntu 18.
And finally. The word after the dash means the version of wine that is available for the operating system.

### List of Distros
+ Ubuntu

### Footnote

If you see an install script here, it is likely that the version of that Distro is no longer supported by Wine or by the development team behind that distro. If you think that script shouldn't be here please open a ticket with reasoning.
Thank you!
